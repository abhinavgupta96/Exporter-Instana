This project allows user to export metrics from popular Application Perfomance Monitoring Tool (Instana). These metrics can be exposed via Prometheus and can be visualized in Grafana. Aim behind this tool was to accumulate data from various tools under one single dashboard allowing engineers to take decisions quickly thus reducing the key metrics of Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR).
